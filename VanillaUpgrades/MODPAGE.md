**Upgrade your existing base-game machines via MAM Research trees!**
Spend Power Shards and tier-appropriate resources to effectively increase the base clock speed of all machines of a type, including existing ones!

Essentially, by purchasing these upgrades, you don't need to install power shards in your machines to increase their speed -
although you can still do so for even more speed.
This means you can upgrade your existing base without having to replace any machines,
and if you ever uninstall the mod, you won't lose any of your machines or their contents,
although they will revert to their base game speeds.

## Available Machine Upgrades

There are **3 upgrade tiers** available for each of the machines below, spread across 4 MAM trees

Production machines generally get upgrades of **+33%**, **+66%**, then **+100%** base clock speed.
The exact upgrade amounts are described in the MAM nodes.

The first upgrade is available with resources from the same HUB Tier you unlock the machine,
with further upgrades requiring more complex resources and additional Power Shards.

## Upgrading a Machine

Upon purchasing an upgrade, **all machines of that type will immediately be upgraded to the new speed, including existing machines**.

For example, if you had a Constructor making 20 Iron Plates per minute by consuming 30 ingots per minute and 4 MW (set to 100% clock speed),
then purchased the first Constructor upgrade,
it will now be making 26.667 plates per minute by consuming 40 ingots per minute and 5.9 MW (set to 100% clock speed).
This is a 33% bonus to the crafting speed, as if you had set the un-upgraded Constructor to 133% clock speed.

Here's a screenshot of this example's Constructor after the Level 1 upgrade has been unlocked:

## Disclaimers

- Building descriptions/stats in the Build Gun menus and recipe estimates in the Codex are not altered to reflect current upgrade effects - they always show the base game values.
- It is possible to achieve resource demands or production rates that exceed the base game's belt and pipe speed limits,
  esepcially if you still install Power Shards in your machines after upgrading them.
  You will need to use other mods to deal with this problem.
  Keep in mind that Satisfactory limitations prevent belt speeds >2000 items/minute and pipe speeds >600 mÂ³/minute.
