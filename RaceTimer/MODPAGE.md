Provides Start and Finish Line buildables. Crossing the Start Line in a vehicle begins a timer that appears on your HUD, which runs until you cross any Finish Line building in a vehicle.

Use the chat command `/ClearRaceTimer` to exit the race early and remove the timer from the screen,
or hide your final race time.
If server hosts want to disable the ability to leave races, add `RaceTimer:ClearRaceTimer` to `disabledChatCommands` in [SML's configuration](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/SMLConfiguration.html#_sml_configuration_options).

Unlocked via a Tier 1 Milestone.

This mod also makes Factory Carts allow players to enter immediately upon placement by default. This is controlled by a
[Mod Savegame Setting](https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/ForUsers/ConfiguringMods.html#_mod_savegame_settings).
